## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Computer Science. I am always eager to work on a new project spanning from app development, full-stack development, artifical intelligence, machine learning, data science, and data structures to new areas of CS. Always looking for the next challenge and leadership opportunity.
